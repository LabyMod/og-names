### Introduction

In this repository we want to collect names and words that get the "_OG Name_" badge
on [laby.net](https://laby.net/badge/667735b8-1d60-40aa-a378-2f76765025ae). <br>
We want the community to be able to contribute to this project by creating issues or pull requests.

### How to contribute

If you want to create a pull-request to add new names to the database,<br>
please provide trusted source that the added names are relevant to our collection.<br>

- A source for forenames could be https://forebears.io/united-states/forenames
- A source for the name "_Zombie_" could be https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Zombie

You can add or remove any names in all ``.txt`` files or create a new category if needed.<br>
But before you commit your changes, please run the script ``cleanup.py`` to sort all names and to remove the invalid ones.

### When do we accept a pull-request?

We do not want to decide which pull-request will be accepted and which not.<br>
We want to let the community discuss and agree on the majority or on the best solution.
We will accept it after a while if there is nothing to discuss.

### When will my changes apply?

We sync the database to LABYnet once a week. So it will take some time for the badges to update.
